# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the data pipeline from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** installed and running
- **Docker Compose** installed
- Terminal access (bash, zsh, or PowerShell)
- A code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

### Verify Docker Installation

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Both commands should return version numbers.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your actual credentials. The `.env.example` file provides a template with placeholder values.

Alternatively, you can create `.env` manually:

```ini
# Database Credentials
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# pgAdmin Credentials
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_pgadmin_password
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Use strong, randomly generated passwords for all credentials!

> üìù **Note**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. Never commit sensitive credentials.

### Step 2: Start All Services

From the project root, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:
1. ‚úÖ Pull required Docker images (if not already present)
2. ‚úÖ Start PostgreSQL database container
3. ‚úÖ Wait for database to be healthy
4. ‚úÖ Run Flyway migrations (create raw tables)
5. ‚úÖ Execute dbt transformations (create staging views and analytics tables)
6. ‚úÖ Launch pgAdmin web interface

The `-d` flag runs containers in detached mode (background).

### Step 3: Verify Services Are Running

Check container status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Expected output**:
```
NAME                      STATUS
my_app_postgres_db        running (healthy)
db_migrator               exited (0)
data_transformer          exited (0)
pgadmin_ui                running
```

**Status meanings**:
- `running (healthy)` - Service is operational
- `exited (0)` - Service completed successfully (migrations and transformations)
- `running` - Service is active

### Step 4: Check Logs (Optional)

If you want to verify everything ran correctly:

```bash
# Database logs
docker compose logs db

# Migration logs
docker compose logs migration

# DBT transformation logs
docker compose logs dbt
```

Look for `Successfully applied` (Flyway) and `Completed successfully` (dbt).

## What Just Happened?

Your data pipeline is now running! Here's what was created:

### Database Schemas Created

1. **`public`** schema (Raw Layer)
   - `raw_products` table
   - `raw_orders` table
   - `raw_order_items` table

2. **`staging`** schema (Cleaning Layer)
   - `stg_products` view
   - `stg_orders` view
   - `stg_order_items` view

3. **`analytics`** schema (Business Intelligence Layer)
   - `dim_products` table
   - `fact_sales` table

## Next Steps

Now that your pipeline is running:

1. **View the data** ‚Üí See [PGADMIN_GUIDE.md](PGADMIN_GUIDE.md) to explore tables
2. **Understand the data flow** ‚Üí See [DATA_FLOW.md](DATA_FLOW.md)
3. **Add sample data** ‚Üí See [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md#adding-sample-data)

## Troubleshooting

### Containers won't start

**Issue**: `docker compose up -d` fails

**Solutions**:
- Check if ports 5432 and 8080 are already in use
- Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs`

### Database connection refused

**Issue**: Cannot connect to database

**Solutions**:
- Wait for health checks to complete: `docker compose ps`
- Verify `.env` file exists and has correct values
- Check database logs: `docker compose logs db`

### dbt transformations failed

**Issue**: `data_transformer` exited with non-zero code

**Solutions**:
- Check dbt logs: `docker compose logs dbt`
- Verify migrations ran successfully
- Rebuild containers: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`

### pgAdmin not accessible

**Issue**: Cannot access http://localhost:8080

**Solutions**:
- Verify pgAdmin container is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check if port 8080 is available: `lsof -i :8080` (Mac/Linux)
- Wait 30-60 seconds for pgAdmin to fully initialize

## Stopping Services

To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

To remove containers and data volumes (complete cleanup):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

**Warning**: `docker compose down -v` will delete all data!
