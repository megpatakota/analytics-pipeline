## ðŸš€ Running Your Production PostgreSQL Service

To run your containerized PostgreSQL database, you primarily need two things: the **`docker-compose.yml`** file (which defines the service) and the **`.env`** file (which holds the secrets).

-----

### 1\. Create the Environment File (`.env`)

This file holds the values for the environment variables defined in your `docker-compose.yml`. For a production setup, these values should be **unique and strong**.

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DB_USER` | `prod_app_user_2025` | Dedicated, non-root user for your application. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `Gk7#pW!qRz8$sX4@tY1^eU6` | **Strong, generated password.** |
| `DB_NAME` | `primary_app_db` | The main database for your application. |

**File Content (`.env`):**

```ini
DB_USER=prod_app_user_2025
DB_PASSWORD=Gk7#pW!qRz8$sX4@tY1^eU6
DB_NAME=primary_app_db
```

-----

### 2\. Execution Command

Ensure both the `docker-compose.yml` and the `.env` file are in the same directory.

Use the following command to build the service (if needed) and start the container **in detached mode** (`-d`).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `docker compose` | Executes Docker Compose commands (using V2). |
| `up` | Builds, creates, and starts the services defined in the YAML file. |
| `-d` | **Detached mode.** Runs the containers in the background, allowing you to close the terminal. |

-----

### 3\. Verification

After running the command, use this to confirm the database is running and reported as healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Expected Output (or similar):**

```
NAME                    COMMAND                   SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
my_app_postgres_db      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"    db                  running (healthy)
```

The key status to look for is **`running (healthy)`**, which means the PostgreSQL server is ready for connections.


to enter postgres
docker exec -it my_app_postgres_db psql -U prod_app_user_2025 -d primary_app_db
